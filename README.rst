ids.storage_hzb - An IDS storage plugin for the HZB
===================================================

This is an `IDS`_ storage plugin adapted to the needs of `HZB`_.  For
the moment, it is in an experimental stage.  It is mostly used to
explore the IDS and to try out how IDS storage plugins can be
customized.


Features
~~~~~~~~

+ Customized, meaningful file names in the storage.  The file name
  layout is::

    <storage-root>/<facility-name>/<prefix>/<inv-name>/<visit-id>/data/<dataset-name>/<datafile-name>

  where ``<prefix>`` corresponds to the facility cycle and is derived
  from the investigation name ``<inv-name>``.

+ External storage areas: a prefix on the location of Datasets and
  Datafiles determines whether it is to be searched in an external
  storage area or not.  These external storage area are accessed
  read-only and are excluded from the standard two-level storage
  mechanism.

+ Use file system locking when accessing the storage to allow
  concurrent access to the storage by external processes.

+ Check the location argument in the callbacks for consistency to work
  around a vulnerability in IDS.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

ids.storage_hzb is based on `ids.storage_file`_.  There is no binary
release, you need to build the distribution from the sources.  Once
this is done, the original install instructions for ids.storage_file
mostly applies to ids.storage_hzb as well, see the general
`installation instructions`_ and the specific `installation
instructions for ids.storage_file`_.

There are a few additional configuration options in
ids.storage_hzb.main.properties though, see the comments in the file.

This plugin requires ids.plugin 1.3.1 and ids.server 1.6.0 or greater.


Bugs and limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ It is impossible to safely remove a lock file from the storage
  without a race condition.  For this reason, this plugin does not
  remove the lock files at all, but rather leaves this to an external
  tool that tries to minimize the risk.  Note that this is not a bug
  in this particular implementation, but rather a design flaw in POSIX
  fcntl() style locks.  The problem is that fcntl() locks are obtained
  on open file descriptors, but there is no way to open and lock a
  file in one single atomic operation.


Release notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 0.3.3 (2016-06-03)
--------------------------

+ Add another directory level "data" above the dataset.

+ Merge ids.storage_file 1.3.3.  This requires ids.server 1.6.0.

Version 0.3.2 (2015-03-05)
--------------------------

Bugfixes:

+ Must not lock directories in external storage areas.

+ Create the directory lock file in the parent directory rather then
  in the directory itself.

Version 0.3.1 (2015-02-27)
--------------------------

Do not check the existence of dataset directories in external storage
areas, rather assume them always to exist, e.g. always return true.
This removes any semantic from the location attribute in Dataset other
then the presence of a storage area prefix, e.g. for Dataset, the
location does not need to be an existing file or directory.

Version 0.3.0 (2015-02-26)
--------------------------

Implement locking of dataset directories in the main storage.

Version 0.2.0 (2015-02-20)
--------------------------

Implement external storage areas.

Version 0.1.0 (2015-01-23)
--------------------------

Basically a customized version of ids.storage_file.  Originally
derived from ids.storage_file 1.2.0, later ported to 1.3.0.
